# FaceRecognition_MTCNN-FACENET-SVM
This repository is the result of a final assignment in the form of designing a combination of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. This project contains a model for the presence of many faces at one time. This model uses the MTCNN model for detection and FaceNet for face embedding and SVM for face classification and prediction.
